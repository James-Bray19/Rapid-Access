# Rapid Access

Rapid Access is a powerful shortcut management tool that allows you to create and manage custom keyboard shortcuts for quick access to applications, files, and websites. With a simple press of the Caps Lock key, you can access the Rapid Access interface and execute your predefined shortcuts effortlessly.

## Getting Started

2. **Extract**: Extract the contents to a location of your choice.
3. **Run**: Once extracted, run the `Rapid-Access.ahk` file.

## Coming Soon

- **Setup Installer**: Installer to make the process of getting started easier and cleaner.
- **Dynamic Link Searching**: Add a web link with a 'REPLACEME' to search within a link, e.g.
    - `https://www.google.com/search?q=REPLACEME` to search Google for a custom phrase
    - `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=REPLACEME` to search YouTube for a custom phrase
- **Clipboard Manager**: Builtin hotkeys for managing multiple shortcuts (useful for coding)
